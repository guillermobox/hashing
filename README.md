# Hashing experiments in rust

To learn the language I am writing some hashing experiments following a few articles.

The articles are:
  - *Universal Classes of Hash Functions*, J. Lawrence Carter and Mark N. Wegman, Journal of Computer and System Sciences 18, 143-154 (1979), DOI: 10.1016/0022-0000(79)90044-8
